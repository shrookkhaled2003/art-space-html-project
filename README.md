*Art Space* is a simple static website created using *pure HTML*.  
It showcases original artwork, creative galleries, and featured artists in a clean and accessible layout—without using CSS or JavaScript.

## Project Overview

This project is part of my HTML learning journey. It demonstrates:
- The use of *Semantic HTML* elements (<header>, <main>, <section>, <nav>, <footer>, etc.)
- Building layouts with *tables* (no CSS)
- Applying *meta tags* for SEO optimization
- Implementing *Accessibility* best practices (alt, aria-label, proper form labels)

## What is Art Space?

*Art Space* is an online platform dedicated to showcasing and celebrating original artworks.  
The idea is to provide a digital gallery where artists can present their creations—such as paintings, illustrations, and exhibitions—in a simple and accessible way using only *HTML*.  

This project reflects the beauty of art while applying fundamental web development concepts.
